It was during the high school where I met the passion for computer technology. My father often said "computers will be the future" that's why I always had pc in my house. But they didn't take my attention until the 1997 where internet came in our home. I played a videogame, Starcraft, for 2 years continuously. I could not believe it was possible to play with anyone in the world. My competitive skills brought me around several cities for tournaments until when I placed 2nd in the first official italian lan party in Milan.

I think I have strong control over my self I couldn't figure out how that game took me out. From there I cut any relationships with videogames definitely and I started to try to understand how they are made and how I can made something like this. With the support of my parents I decided to start study computer science at the college.

During those years I felt like an artist: I could have the skills to image an idea, realize it and then make it available to other people. It was like an infinite loop where I needed to study to complete a new creation and so on. I tested my self, on 2011, when I decided to write entirely by self, line by line of code, a website about spearfishing. It should have been a place where users could share their passion through pictures and videos. It was an unexpected success: thousand of users joined the community and I worked day and night always with the smile on my face.

The mobile world joined after while. In those years all web sites started to support mobile format and my portal began to feel old prematurely. I didn't give up and I studied mobile techologies so my mobile app shipped on the main stores on 2013. A new world came on my eyes.

All these side projects happened during 10 years where I worked for many company too. My best years were in 3 startups where I met a lot of talented people and where I was lead by inspired bosses that allowed me to express my best in every situation. I touched a lot of technologies, programming languages, worked in data and service but also in the frontend side too. I have a great experience in user interfaces and game engines. My jobs brougth me around the central and south America: Mexico for about 1 year, before in Brasile and then in Bolivia

Sea is my deep passion, over and under its surface. Holding breath and going down brings me to a new world where I can feel like a guest and like at home at the same time. It's clear I love the nature expecially when I can live it alone.

The Digital Team for me it's like a super heroes squad. Be part of it makes me proud and I am sure it makes me grow as a professional and as human being too. Now I can do something usefull in first person. This is a challenge and this makes it all more fascinating.
