The passion for computer technology grew for me at the time of the high school. My father often said "computers will be the future" hence I always had a pc at home. Although it wasn’t enough to draw my attention until the 1997 when Internet came in our home. I started to play a video game, Starcraft, for 2 years continuously. I couldn’t believe it was possible to play with anyone in the world. My competitive skills brought me around several cities for tournaments until I placed 2nd in the first official italian LAN party in Milan.

I think I have strong self-control, yet I couldn't figure out how that game kidnapped me. Afterwards I cut definitely all the relationships with videogames and I started to try to understand how they were actually made and how I could make something like that. With the support of my parents I decided to start studying computer science at the college.

During those years I felt like I was an artist: I had the skills to image an idea, develop it and then make it available to other people. It was like being inside an infinite loop where I needed to study to complete a new creation and so on. I set a challenge for myself, on 2011, when I decided to write entirely alone, line by line, a website about spearfishing. It should have been a place where users could share their passions through their pictures and videos. It was an unexpected success: thousand of users joined the community and I worked day and night always with the smile on my face.

The mobile world joined after a while. In those years all web sites started to support mobile format and my portal began to feel old prematurely. I didn't give up and I studied mobile technologies thus my mobile app shipped on the main app stores on 2013. A new world appeared before my eyes.

All these side projects happened through 10 years where I also worked for many companies. My best experiences were in 3 startups where I met a lot of talented people and where I was lead by inspired managers allowing me to be my best self in every situation. I touched a lot of technologies, programming languages, worked on frontends and backends, managing data and offering services. I have a great experience in user interfaces and game engines. My jobs brought me around entral and South America: Mexico for about 1 year, before in Brazil and afterwards in Bolivia.

Sea is my strong passion, above and below its surface. Holding breath and deep diving brings me to a new world where I can feel like a guest and at home at the same time. For sure I love nature especially when I live it alone.

The Digital Team for me it's like a super heroes squad. Be part of it makes me proud and I am sure it makes me grow as a professional and as human being too. Now I can produce something useful for my society in first person. This is a challenge and it makes all even more fascinating.
